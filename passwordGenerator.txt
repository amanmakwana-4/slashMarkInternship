--------------------------------------------------------EXPLAIN---------------------------------------------------
This is a Java program that generates a random password of a specified length. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Importing the Random class

The first line imports the java.util.Random class, which is used to generate random numbers.

Defining the passwordGenerator class

The passwordGenerator class is defined, which contains two methods: generatePassword and main.

Defining the CHARACTERS constant

A private static final string constant CHARACTERS is defined, which contains a string of all possible characters that can be used to generate the password. This string includes:

    Uppercase letters (A-Z)
    Lowercase letters (a-z)
    Digits (0-9)
    Special characters (!, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, (, ), _, +, -)

The generatePassword method

This method takes an integer length as a parameter, which specifies the length of the password to be generated. It returns a string representing the generated password.

Here's what the method does:

    Creates a StringBuilder object password to build the password string.
    Creates a Random object random to generate random numbers.
    Loops length times, and in each iteration:
        Generates a random index i between 0 and the length of the CHARACTERS string using random.nextInt(CHARACTERS.length()).
        Appends the character at the generated index i from the CHARACTERS string to the password StringBuilder using password.append(CHARACTERS.charAt(i)).
    Returns the completed password string as a string using password.toString().

The main method

This is the entry point of the program. It does the following:

    Sets the passwordLength variable to 12, which specifies the length of the password to be generated. You can change this value to generate passwords of different lengths.
    Calls the generatePassword method with the passwordLength as an argument, and stores the generated password in the password variable.
    Prints the generated password to the console using System.out.println.

When you run this program, it will generate a random password of the specified length (12 in this case) and print it to the console
